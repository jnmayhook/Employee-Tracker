# Employee Tracker

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases easily.  These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).  This command-line application features a companyâ€™s employee database and was built using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.  When the application is run, the user is prompted with a list of questions: to view and manage departments, roles, and employees.  Depending on which category is selected, the user is presented with a formatted table showing the desired data.
